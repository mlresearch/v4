<h3>Abstract</h3>

Satellite images are numerous and weakly exploited: it is urgent to develop efficient and fast 
indexing algorithms to facilitate their access. In order to determinate the best features to be 
extracted, we propose a methodology based on automatic feature selection algorithms, applied 
unsupervisingly on a strongly redundant features set. In this article we also demonstrate the 
usefulness of consensus clustering as a feature selection algorithm, allowing selected number 
of features estimation and exploration facilities. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated on SPOT5 images.
