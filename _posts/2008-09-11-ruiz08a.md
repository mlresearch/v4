title: Best Agglomerative Ranked Subset for Feature Selection
abstract: The enormous increase of the size in databases makes finding an optimal
  subset  of features extremely difficult. In this paper, a new feature selection
  method  is proposed that will allow any subset evaluator -including the wrapper  evaluation
  method- to be used to find a group of features that will allow a  distinction to
  be made between the different possible classes. The method,  BARS (Best Agglomerative
  Ranked Subset), is based on the idea of relevance and  redundancy, in the sense
  that a ranked feature (or set) is more relevant if it  adds information when it
  is included in the final subset of selected features.  This heuristic method reduces
  dimensionality drastically and leads to improvements  in the accuracy, in comparison
  to a complete set and as opposed to other feature  selection algorithms.
