title: Unsupervised feature selection applied to SPOT5 satellite images indexing
abstract: 'Satellite images are numerous and weakly exploited: it is urgent to develop
  efficient and fast  indexing algorithms to facilitate their access. In order to
  determinate the best features to be  extracted, we propose a methodology based on
  automatic feature selection algorithms, applied  unsupervisingly on a strongly redundant
  features set. In this article we also demonstrate the  usefulness of consensus clustering
  as a feature selection algorithm, allowing selected number  of features estimation
  and exploration facilities. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated on SPOT5
  images.'
