title: On the Relationship Between Feature Selection and Classification Accuracy
abstract: Dimensionality reduction and feature subset selection are two techniques
  for reducing the attribute space of a feature set, which is an important component
  of both supervised and unsupervised classification or regression problems. While
  in feature subset selection a subset of the original attributes is extracted, dimensionality
  reduction in general produces linear combinations of the original attribute set.
  In this paper we investigate the relationship between several attribute space reduction
  techniques and the resulting classification accuracy for two very different application
  areas. On the one hand, we consider e-mail filtering, where the feature space contains
  various properties of e-mail messages, and on the other hand, we consider drug discovery
  problems, where quantitative representations of molecular structures are encoded
  in terms of information-preserving descriptor values.   Subsets of the original
  attributes constructed by filter and wrapper techniques as well as subsets of linear
  combinations of the original attributes constructed by three different variants
  of the principle component analysis (PCA) are compared in terms of the classification
  performance achieved with various machine learning algorithms as well as in terms
  of runtime performance. We successively reduce the size of the attribute sets and
  investigate the changes in the classification results. Moreover, we explore the
  relationship between the variance captured in the linear combinations within PCA
  and the resulting classification accuracy.  The results show that the classification
  accuracy based on PCA is highly sensitive to the type of data and that the variance
  captured the principal components is not necessarily a vital indicator for the classification
  performance.
