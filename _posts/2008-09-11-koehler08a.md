title: Unsupervised Feature Selection for Pattern Discovery in Seismic Wavefields
abstract: This study presents an unsupervised feature selection approach for the discovery  of
  significant patterns in seismic wavefields. We iteratively reduce the number  of
  features generated from seismic time series by first considering significance  of
  individual features. Significance testing is done by assessing the randomness  of
  the time series with the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test and by comparing observed and  theoretical
  variability of features. In a second step the in-between feature  dependencies are
  assessed based on correlation hunting in feature subsets using  Self-Organizing
  Maps (SOMs). We show the improved discriminative power of our  procedure compared
  to manually selected feature subsets by cross-validation applied  to synthetic seismic
  wavefield data. Furthermore, we apply the method to real-world  data with the aim
  to define suitable features for earthquake detection and seismic  phase classification
  in seismic recordings.
