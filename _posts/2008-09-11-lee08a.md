title: Quality assessment of nonlinear dimensionality reduction based on K-ary neighborhoods
abstract: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction aims at providing low-dimensional representions
  of high-dimensional data sets. Many new methods have been recently proposed, but
  the question of their assessment and comparison remains open. This paper reviews
  some of the existing quality measures that are based on distance ranking and K-ary
  neighborhoods. In this context, the comparison of the ranks in the high- and low-dimensional
  spaces leads to the definition of the co-ranking matrix. Rank errors and concepts
  such as neighborhood intrusions and extrusions can be associated with different
  blocks of the co-ranking matrix. The considered quality criteria are then cast within
  this unifying framework and the blocks they involve are identified. The same framework
  allows us to propose simpler criteria, which quantify two aspects of the embedding,
  namely its overall quality and its tendency to favor either intrusions or extrusions.
  Eventually, a simple experiment illustrates the soundness of the approach.
