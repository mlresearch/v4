title: Approximating Mutual Information by Maximum Likelihood Density Ratio Estimation
abstract: Mutual information is useful in various data processing tasks such as feature
  selection or independent component analysis. In this paper, we propose a new method
  of approximating mutual information based on maximum likelihood estimation of a
  density ratio function. Our method, called Maximum Likelihood Mutual Information
  (MLMI), has several attractive properties, e.g., density estimation is not involved,
  it is a single-shot procedure, the global optimal solution can be efficiently computed,
  and cross-validation is available for model selection. Numerical experiments show
  that MLMI compares favorably with existing methods.
