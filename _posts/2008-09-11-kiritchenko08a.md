title: Keyword Optimization in Sponsored Search via Feature Selection
abstract: 'Sponsored search is a new application domain for the feature selection
  area of research.  When a user searches for products or services using the Internet,
  most of the major search  engines would return two sets of results: regular web
  pages and paid advertisements.  An advertising company provides a set of keywords
  associated with an ad. If one of these  keywords is present in a user''s query,
  the ad is displayed, but the company is charged  only if the user actually clicks
  on the ad. Ultimately, a company would like to advertise  on the most effective
  keywords to attract only prospective customers. A set of keywords  can be optimized
  based on historic performance. We propose to optimize advertising keywords  with
  feature selection techniques applied to the set of all possible word combinations  comprising
  past users'' queries. Unlike previous work in this area, our approach not only  recognizes
  the most profitable keywords, but also discovers more specific combinations  of
  keywords and other relevant words.'
