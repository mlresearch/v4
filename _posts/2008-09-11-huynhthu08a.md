title: Exploiting tree-based variable importances to selectively identify relevant
  variables
abstract: This  paper   proposes  a  novel  statistical   procedure  based  on   permutation  tests  for  extracting   a  subset  of  truly  relevant   variables  from   multivariate  importance  rankings   derived  from   tree-based  supervised
  learning  methods.   It shows  also that  the   direct  extension of  the  classical
  approach  based on  permutation   tests for  estimating false  discovery rates of  univariate
  variable   scoring  procedures  does  not  extend  very well  to  the  case  of   multivariate  tree-based  importance  measures.
