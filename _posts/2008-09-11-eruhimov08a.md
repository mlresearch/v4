title: Transferring Knowledge by Prior Feature Sampling
abstract: 'The paper presents a novel method for transfer learning through prior variable
  sampling. A set of problems defined in the same feature space with similar dependencies
  of target on features is considered. We suggest a method for learning a decision
  tree ensemble on each of the problems by prior estimation of variable importance
  on other problems in the set and using it for regularizing model learning for a
  small amount of training samples. The method is tested on several simulated and
  real datasets. In particular, we apply our method for a set of time series classification
  (TSC) problems. Our analysis demonstrates an intriguing result: a model trained
  on several TSC problems can learn a new problem with high accuracy from a low number
  of samples.'
