title: Multi-Source Feature Selection via Geometry-Dependent Covariance Analysis
abstract: 'Feature selection is an effective approach to reducing dimensionality by
  selecting relevant original features. In this work, we studied a novel problem of
  multi-source feature selection for unlabeled data: given multiple heterogeneous
  data sources (or data sets), select features from one source of interest by integrating
  information from various data sources. In essence, we investigate how we can employ
  the information contained in multiple data sources to effectively derive intrinsic
  relationships that can help select more meaningful (or domain relevant) features.
  We studied how to adjust the covariance matrix of a data set using the geometric
  structure obtained from multiple data sources, and how to select features of the
  target source using geometry-dependent covariance. We designed and conducted experiments
  to systematically compare the proposed approach with representative methods in our
  attempt to solve the novel problem of multi-source feature selection. The empirical
  study demonstrated the efficacy and potential of multi-source feature selection.'
