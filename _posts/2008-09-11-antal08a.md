title: 'A Bayesian View of Challenges in Feature Selection: Feature Aggregation, Multiple
  Targets, Redundancy and Interaction'
abstract: In the paper we discuss applications of the Bayesian approach to new challenges
  in relevance analysis. Earlier, we formulated a Bayesian approach to Feature Subset
  Selection using Bayesian networks to jointly estimate the posteriors of Markov Blanket
  Memberships (MBMs), Markov Blanket Sets (MBSs), and Markov Blanket Graphs (MBGs)
  for a given target variable. These results of the Bayesian Multilevel Analysis of
  relevance (BMLA) correspond respectively to a model-based pairwise relevance, relevance
  of sets, and to the interaction models of relevant variables. Now we formulate refined
  levels in BMLA by introducing the concepts of k-MBSs and k-MBGs, which are intermediate,
  scalable model properties expressing relevance. We consider the extension of BMLA
  to multiple targets. We introduce and investigate a score for feature redundancy
  and interaction based on the decomposability of the structure posterior. Finally,
  we overview the problems of conditional and contextual relevance. We demonstrate
  the use of concepts and methods in the field of genomics of asthma.
