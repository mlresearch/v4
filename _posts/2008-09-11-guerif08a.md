title: 'Unsupervised Variable Selection: when random rankings sound as irrelevancy'
abstract: Whereas the variable selection has been extensively studied in the context
  of  supervised learning, the unsupervised variable selection has attracted attention  of
  researchers more recently as the available amount of unlabeled data has exploded.  Many
  unsupervised variable ranking criteria were proposed and their relevance is usually  demonstrated
  using either external cluster validity indexes or the accuracy of a classifier  which
  are both supervised criteria. Actually, the major issue of the variable subset selection  according
  to a ranking measure has been adressed only by few authors in the unsupervised  learning
  context. In this paper, we propose to combine multiple ranking to go ahead toward  a
  stable consensus variable subset in a totally unsupervised fashion.
