<h3>Abstract</h3>

  This  paper   proposes  a  novel  statistical   procedure  based  on
  permutation  tests  for  extracting   a  subset  of  truly  relevant
  variables  from   multivariate  importance  rankings   derived  from
  tree-based  supervised learning  methods.   It shows  also that  the
  direct  extension of  the  classical approach  based on  permutation
  tests for  estimating false  discovery rates of  univariate variable
  scoring  procedures  does  not  extend  very well  to  the  case  of
  multivariate  tree-based  importance  measures.
