<h3>Abstract</h3>

Sponsored search is a new application domain for the feature selection area of research. 
When a user searches for products or services using the Internet, most of the major search 
engines would return two sets of results: regular web pages and paid advertisements. 
An advertising company provides a set of keywords associated with an ad. If one of these 
keywords is present in a user's query, the ad is displayed, but the company is charged 
only if the user actually clicks on the ad. Ultimately, a company would like to advertise 
on the most effective keywords to attract only prospective customers. A set of keywords 
can be optimized based on historic performance. We propose to optimize advertising keywords 
with feature selection techniques applied to the set of all possible word combinations 
comprising past users' queries. Unlike previous work in this area, our approach not only 
recognizes the most profitable keywords, but also discovers more specific combinations 
of keywords and other relevant words.
